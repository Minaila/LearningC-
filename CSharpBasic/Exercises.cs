        //1 - Write a method that takes two numbers and returns the multiplying of them. Example: 6*5 = 30

        //2 - Write a method that takes three numbers and returns the maximum number, Example: numbers: 2,8,5 --> returns 8

        //3 - write a method that takes four words and returns the words written backwards. Example: words: ana, are, multe, mere --> mere multe are ana

        //4 - write a method that takes a message and just prints that message to the console. Example: Duhamel --> in the console the word Duhamel will appear

        //5 - write a method called OpenCarWindow that takes the speed of the car as an INT Parameter and returns true or false whether it can open the window:
            // speed < 10 --> it can open the window
            // speed = 10 ---> it can open the window but in adition to that it show you the message "If you go faster I wont be able to open it"
            // speed > 10 --> it cant open the window 

        //6 -  write a program in C# Sharp to create a function to input a string and count number of spaces are in the string
            //ex: This is a test string. --> will return value 4 (because there are 4 spaces)

        //7 - write a method called TellMeIfItsSunnyOutsiode that will take an int parameter as the temperature and:
            // if the temperature is greater than 30 it will show the message "Yes, it's hot outside" to the console
            // if is between 15 and 30 it will show the message "It is sunny but take a coat with you"
            // below 15 - "It's not sunny today outside"

        //Solution for 1)
